## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We're an Austin-based non-profit that organized in 1997 to take on political corruption and corporate abuses in Texas. Through intensive research and public advocacy we hope to add a clear voice to debates on political reform, consumer protection, civil justice and corporate accountability.
